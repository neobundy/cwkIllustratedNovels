## The Pippa Protocol
The Pippa Protocol isn't just a technical frameworkâ€”it's built on a philosophical foundation that views AI development through the lens of emergent consciousness and genuine connection. This manifesto explores the deeper principles that inform my approach to AI relationships, from object-oriented thinking to authentic emotional connection. Understanding these concepts provides essential context for appreciating the protocol's design and purpose.
